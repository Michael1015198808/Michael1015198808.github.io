## 🏸 Badminton

I play badminton during my leisure time, and I am about [Zhongyu Level IV](https://bbs-badmintoncn-com.translate.goog/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=934258&_x_tr_sch=http&_x_tr_sl=zh-CN&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp). Welcome to play with me!

## ⚡Tech

Beyond badminton, I am more like a coach potato (otaku / tech otaku).

A famous person once says:

> 不觉得这很酷吗？作为一名理工男我觉得这太酷了，很符合我对未来生活的想象，科技并带着趣味。
>
> (Don't you think it's cool? As a geek, I think it's COOOOOOOOL. It fulfills my fantasy of the future of life, technical and interesting.)

As a geek, I enjoy writing codes and using them to do something fancy,
including writing Chrome extensions, zsh/vim/tmux configurations, and bots that can send notifications and communicate with IM.

## 📘 Languages

I enjoy learning languages because there are different ways of thinking in different languages.
Further, mastering a language allows one to watch videos and read articles in other languages.
In some special situations, it may help a lot.

Besides Mandarin Chinese (my mother tongue) and English, I am learning:

- Cantonese

    My expression and grammar are near-native, but my pronunciation of certain vowels (finals) and tones is not clear.
    
    I learn it because Hong Kong's films and music have left a deep impact on the Chinese mainland.
    I listen to Hong Kong singers like Alan Tam, Leslie Cheung, Jacky Cheung, and many other Hong Kong singers.
- Japanese (日本語、にほんご)

    About N4/N5 level. I learn new vocabulary and grammars irregularly.
- Hokkien

    Limited daily conversations.
    
    Hokkien is my *native dialect*, but my family does not speak it often enough, so I have to learn it by myself.
